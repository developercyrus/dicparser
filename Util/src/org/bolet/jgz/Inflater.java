	/*
	 * Most of the decompression works by decoding symbols from the
	 * incoming bit stream, using a Huffman tree. A Huffman tree is
	 * a binary tree where each node is either a leaf, representing
	 * a symbol, or has two child trees: the left child is used if the
	 * next bit is a 0, the right child otherwise. The tree cannot be
	 * mono-leaf, i.e. its root node cannot be a leaf (all symbols
	 * use at least 1 bit). Except for the trivial tree used for a
	 * stream with only one symbol (the root node has two sons which
	 * are leaves and both encode that exact symbol), all leaves
	 * reference distinct symbols. Hence, if the n distinct symbols
	 * appear, then the tree contains exactly n-1 non-leaf nodes.
	 *
	 * Note: all leaves must exist. We _could_ tolerate trees with
	 * missing leaves (which are trivially non-optimal) but such
	 * trees are, according to Mark Adler (one of the authors of
	 * zlib), an error which MUST be reported as such.
	 *
	 * Our base tree encoding is an array of "int". Each entry
	 * encodes a non-leaf node: its lower 16 bits encode the path
	 * to the left child, while its upper 16 bits encode the path
	 * to the right child. If such a 16-bit value has its upper (15th)
	 * bit set, then the corresponding child is a leaf with the symbol
	 * value equal to the low 15 bits. Otherwise, the low 15 bits
	 * contain the index for the non-leaf child node. The tree root
	 * is at index 0.
	 *
	 * This representation needs one array access for each input
	 * bit. In order to speed up things, we have an alternate
	 * representation with a lookup table. It so happens that the
	 * input stream provides bytes, which means that when we want to
	 * decode the next symbol, we have up to 8 bits of lookahead. If
	 * we have q look-ahead bits (1 <= q <= 8), with collective
	 * numerical value v, then we lookup element (1<<q)+v in the
	 * table. That table contains an integer: if its 15th bit is
	 * set, then the low 15 bits encode the matched symbol value,
	 * and the bits 16 and above encode the number of bits which
	 * were actually consumed (no more than q, of course). If the
	 * value does not have its 15th bit set, then all q bits were
	 * consumed and the decoder should continue from the tree node
	 * which has the value as index. If the look-ahead bits cannot
	 * actually occur, then the value is -1.
	 *
	 * The fast lookup table uses indexes from 2 to 511 (inclusive),
	 * which allows for a tree representation compatible with the
	 * non-optimized tree: the tree root is at index 0, and the rest
	 * of the tree is at indexes 512 and above. Hence, the
	 * non-optimized decode function can be used with both tree
	 * types. Non-optimized trees are faster to encode: we will use
	 * a non-optimized tree for the tree-encoder tree, and optimized
	 * trees for the main literal and distance encoder trees.
