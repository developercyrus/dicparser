/**
 * <p>This class implements a decoder stream for a compressed data
 * stream in <code>zlib</code> format (RFC 1950).</p>
 *
 * <p>Such a stream is self-terminated; <code>read()</code> requests
 * will return -1 if the logical data end has been reached, regardless
 * of the status of the underlying stream, which may contain more
 * data. <code>Zlib</code> streams have an internal 32-bit checksum,
 * which this implementation verifies when the stream logical end is
 * reached (a read attempt beyond the end is enough to trigger this
 * verification; calling <code>close()</code> also works).</p>
 *
 * <p><code>Zlib</code> streams may use a dictionary, which is a bunch
 * of uncompressed data that the compressor may use for backward
 * references, as if it has been compressed and transmitted beforehand.
 * The checksum is <emph>not</emph> computed over the dictionary.
 * However, for indexing purposes, the checksum of the dictionary is
 * provided in the stream. Whether a dictionary must be used or not is
 * indicated in the stream. This class does <emph>not</emph> check that
 * a dictionary is indeed provided as requested. It does not check
 * either whether the provided dictionary matches the checksum which is
 * indicated in the stream header.</p>
 *
 * <p>The stream may be initialized with the <code>partial</code> flag
 * set; in that mode, <code>read()</code> requests mark a stop at the
 * end of each deflate block. More precisely, <code>read(byte[])</code>
 * and <code>read(byte[],int,int)</code> normally process input data
 * until the logical stream end or the output buffer size, whichever
 * comes first; in <code>partial</code> mode, these functions will
 * return bytes from only one deflate block at most. This allows the
 * calling application to implement stateful interruptions, as is
 * required for some streaming protocols (e.g. SSH). A consequence is
 * that <code>read(byte[])</code> and <code>read(byte[],int,int)</code>
 * may return 0, if the next block happens to be empty
 * (<strong>warning:</strong> this is in violation of the
 * <code>InputStream</code> API).</p>
