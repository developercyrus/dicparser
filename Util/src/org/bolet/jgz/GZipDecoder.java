/**
 * <p>This class implements a generic decoder for <code>gzip</code>
 * stream headers. A <code>gzip</code> stream is a concatenation of
 * "members". Each member is compressed with a method (the only
 * currently defined method is number 8, for the "deflate" algorithm)
 * and is associated with some meta-information, such as the source file
 * name or last modification time.</p>
 *
 * <p>A <code>GZipDecoder</code> instance can be used to decode the
 * member headers. Note that this class does not handle decompression
 * itself: the decompressor must be invoked externally. The
 * <code>gzip</code> format (documented in RFC 1952) assumes that
 * compressed data is self-terminated; hence, the member header does not
 * contain any indication as to the compressed data length.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each member begins with a header, followed by the compressed data,
 * and then a member footer. The member footer contains the uncompressed
 * data length (truncated to 32-bit) and a 32-bit CRC checksum on the
 * uncompressed data; both values shall be used to check successful
 * decompression. The stream processing should go thus:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Decode the next member header.</li>
 * <li>Process the meta-information, if needed.</li>
 * <li>Uncompress the data; optionaly, keep a count of the uncompressed
 * data length, and a running CRC.</li>
 * <li>Decode the member footer; optionaly, check the uncompressed data
 * length and CRC value.</li>
 * <li>Get back to step 1.</li>
 * </ol></p>
 *
 * <p>Check of length and CRC are <emph>highly recommanded</emph>. There
 * is no indication, neither in the header nor in the footer, about
 * whether the member is final or not. Hence, the end of the underlying
 * stream should provide that information. Such end-of-stream may occur
 * only immediately after a member footer.</p>
 *
 * <p>The <code>get*()</code> methods provide access to data obtained by
 * decoding the member header or footer. Unless otherwise specified, the
 * data is made available when the header has been decoded; the
 * uncompressed data size and CRC are decoded from the footer, which means
 * that their value becomes available only after a call to
 * <code>closeMember()</code>.</p>
