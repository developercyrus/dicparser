/**
 * <p>This class decompresses a data stream compressed in the
 * <code>gzip</code> format, as documented in RFC 1952. It is somewhat
 * similar to the standard <code>java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream</code>
 * class.</p>
 *
 * <p>This stream is <strong>blocking</strong>: when asked to read a
 * given amount of uncompressed bytes, it will return that number of
 * bytes, possibly invoking many times the underlying stream. A short
 * count is possible only if the end of the underlying stream was
 * reached. Note that end-of-stream may occur only between
 * <code>gzip</code> "members"; unexpected end-of-stream is a format
 * error which is reported as such.</p>
 *
 * <p><code>gzip</code> streams may contain some meta-information such
 * as a file name or producer OS; these are not returned by this class.
 * To access meta-information, use the more generic
 * <code>GZipDecoder</code> class.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> that the provided source
 * input stream is buffered. The inflater engine will read it byte by
 * byte most of the time.</p>
