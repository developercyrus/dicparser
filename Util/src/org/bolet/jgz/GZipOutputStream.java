/**
 * <p>This class represents a stream which compress data into the
 * <code>gzip</code> format, as specified in RFC 1952.</p>
 *
 * <p><code>gzip</code> streams contain meta-information in various
 * fields, some of which being optional. This class class sets these
 * fields to default, rather uninformative values: the OS field is set
 * to 255 ("unknown"), the original file name is not included, and the
 * original file modification time is set to 0. These values are legal,
 * according to RFC 1952, and almost no application uses these fields
 * anyway.</p>
 *
 * <p>The compression level can be specified, as a symbolic value
 * identical to what the <code>Deflater</code> class expects. The
 * default compression level is <code>MEDIUM</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since compression is inherently buffered, the provided stream
 * needs not feature buffers.</p>
